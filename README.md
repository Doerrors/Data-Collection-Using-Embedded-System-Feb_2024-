This is a Data Collection Project for Environmental Observation.
To collect the real time data for a whole day, whole week, whole month I automated this data collection process using Embedded system.
This automated process collects Temperature, Humidity and Co2 level in atmosphere using Sensors like DHT11 and mg8266.
This data will be used for future encironmental analysis.
